# abc_of_classification_MNIST
I will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Cen‐ sus Bureau. 
Each image is labeled with the digit it represents.

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
